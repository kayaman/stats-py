1. What parts were written well?
2. What parts would be more difficult to understand?

A) The whole memorandum is very well written. The memo is perfectly divided into segments and all them are very concise and clear. There is an awesome balance of technical and contextual explanations on each of them.

B) The memorandum is well written. In my opinion it could be better split into different segments. Looking overall the memorandum's text is concise, complete and clear. But is written without any subdivisions. I think they could help improve the readability. 

- The study design should be described in this memo. Comment on how the submission addresses cross-over design.

1. What is described well?
2. What is missing? How might the description be improved?

A) The usage of cross over experiment design on this study is correctly and clearly addressed. The reasons and outcomes of the choice are well explained, strong, clear and detailed. It would be nice to mention the benefits of this approach given the size of the sample.

B) The usage of cross over experiment design on this study is not clearly addressed. The reasons and outcomes of the choice are not explained, unclear and not detailed. It would be nice to mention the benefits of this approach given its huge importance on this experiment and also due the size of the sample.

- Comment on how the submission addresses the small sample size, what p-values indicate about the results, and the meaning of statistical significance.

1. What is explained well?
2. What is missing? How might the explanation be improved?

A) The fact that we are dealing with a very small sample size is very well addressed. All possible statistical subjects are detailed and properly addressed. The author's dissertation on how each of the techniques are applied and combined are very well done.

B) The fact that we are dealing with a very small sample size is not mentioned. All possible statistical subjects are detailed and properly addressed. The author's dissertation on how each of the techniques are applied and combined are well done. But the throroughly effort on explaining the reader each of the individual concepts, in my opinion, makes the text a bit annoying. There should be a less offensive way of dealing with a reader with little or basic literacy on the subject.

- Comment on how the submission provides an **interpretation** of both confidence intervals, and an explanation of the meaning of the confidence level in context.

1. What is interpreted well?

The author's dissertation provides very accurate and clear discussion and interpretation of the concepts and values obtained in the experiment. Both confidence intervals and confidence levels are used correctly to interpret and obtain a final verdict.

1. What is described well?
2. What is missing? How might the description be improved?

A) The author's final statements and recommendations are excellent. The author not only take the most accurate interpretations from the statistical study to give a recommendation and his point of view, but carefully think outside the box introducing other important questions from outside the experiment. Excellent job!

B) The author's final statements and recommendations are short but good. The author only take the interpretations from the statistical study to give a recommendation and his point of view. There is plenty of room to think outside the box introducing other important questions from outside the experiment. Good job overall.
