SUBJECT: Impact on performance by having chocolate on the diet of professional cyclists

Nowadays cycling became an extremely sport and technology, on training strategies, equipment and nutrition are all very advanced. To be competitive, every detail counts. All areas are crucial to overall success, must be taken seriously and nutrition is one of them.

You asked me to analyse studies and data from experiments on using chocolate as part of the regular diet of professional riders and help you decide the best choice for your team. 


**Cross over experiment design**


In medicine, a cross over study or cross over trial is a longitudinal study in which subjects receive a sequence of different treatments (or exposures). While cross over studies can be observational studies, many important cross over studies are controlled experiments. Cross over designs are common for experiments in many scientific disciplines, such as sports medicine. Randomised, controlled cross over experiments are especially important in health care. In a randomised clinical trial, the subjects are randomly assigned to different arms of the study which receive different treatments. When the trial has a repeated measures design, the same measures are collected multiple times for each subject. A cross over trial has a repeated measures design in which each patient is assigned to a sequence of two or more treatments, of which one may be a standard treatment or a placebo. Nearly all cross over are designed to have "balance", whereby all subjects receive the same number of treatments and participate for the same number of periods. In most cross over trials each subject receives all treatments, in a random order. Statisticians suggest that designs should have four periods, which is more efficient than the two-period design, even if the study must be truncated to three periods. However, the two-period design was the choice for our experiment because of its simplicity.


**Analysis**


The confidence level is extremely important in this experiment, due the fact of having a small sample. The confidence level varies significantly between the usage of dark and white chocolate. The adoption of dark chocolate not only presents a much higher impact of performance but also provides a pretty higher significance level. The results show that the use of white chocolate are not trustworthy on obtaining an increased performance. 


**Conclusion**

Given the experiment results and its high significance level I would strongly recommend the adoption of dark chocolate as part of the diet of professional riders from your team. The nutritional benefits are clearly shown as an increased performance measurements.
